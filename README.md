    1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
     Different approaches should be adopted to ensure that the code/program/software is functional and secure. The most important ones are adhering to best coding practices, including security aspects, and testing code frequently. The small portions of code should be tested first. Early bug detection is one of the cornerstones of the successful software development process; thus, covering the base code with an efficient number of tests, including all functionalities, is crucial. 
     
    2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
	Gathering, clarifying, and documenting user requirements is a critical step that significantly benefits the development process. Therefore, I would thoroughly assess this stage to ensure a harmonious alignment between requirements and capabilities. Requirements serve as the skeleton or foundation of future software upon which its success relies. I will make sure the user needs are gathered, clarified, and not ambiguous.
 
    3. How do I approach designing software?
I would approach designing software by gathering requirements, discussing them with the development team, and clarifying ambiguous or missing information. Then, the main aspects would be implemented and tested, and feedback would be gathered to start the new development cycle.
